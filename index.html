        Learning last week was extremely interesting. The three things I learned mostly about were assignment operators, control flow, and the difference between static
        websites and dynamic websites. 
        Assignment operators in JS are used to assign variables to values and perform arithmetic (or bitwise) operations on them. 
        Control flow is how you manage the loops and conditionals in your code. 
        Finally, static websites only have pre-created files that the user can send an HTTP request for and the static site can only respond with data from those pre-created files.
        Dynamic sites, on the other hand, dynamically create files and pages using HTML templates and a database based on the user's HTTP request. The CSS, JS, and images are usually pre-created files as well as the HTML templates,
        but unlike static sites you will not have an HTML file for every page that can be opened on your website, the back-end framework you use will dynamically create pages for the user based on the templates you created.

            for the goal I want to achieve.
